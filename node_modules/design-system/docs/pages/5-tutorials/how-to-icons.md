## Add a new icon in Design system

1. Verify and add your svg file resource under the [src/assets/icons](https://github.com/theiconic/design-system/tree/master/src/asset){.link .strong} folder

    - Keep in the mind that your svg file shouldn't have any "transform" or "rotate" attributes but use "*single layer". Please check with your designer to provide the asset correctly, otherwise it won't render 

2. Add your icon's name in the icon config - [icons-sprite.config.json](https://github.com/theiconic/design-system/blob/master/src/assets/icons-sprite.config.json){.link .strong}

    - Design system will generate the icons-sprite.symbol file with icons that are in the above config.
    - __**How to generate all icons?**__ Update your environment as development in .env `ENV=development` before you want to run the command

3. Run command to build the icon preview and deploy 

    - To fix/build your icon
    ```sh
    npm run build 
    ```
    
    - To generate icon-sprite file under static folder
    ```sh
    npm run deploy 
    ```

4. Release a new design system tag in [here](https://github.com/theiconic/design-system/releases){.link .strong} and update its tag in your project.
