## Setup design system for local development

When working on Design System, it is important to test the changes locally before they get push and approved for release.

Taking Alice project as an example for development, we need to link design system locally and then inside alice's docker container.

Please follow next 3 steps:

### 1. Linking DS to Alice docker container
1. Copy `docker-compose.override.yml.dist` from Design System root
2. Go to `docker multimachine` project root, paste file and remove `.dist` extension. New name will be `docker-compose.override.yml`.
3. Restart `alice` project container by running:
    ```bash
    docker rm -f alice-php7 && make install
    ```

#### How to verify it?
Simple, when local design system was linked to Alice from docker multimachine, then you can verify that every time you add a new file, it will be shown inside Alice container.

To to so please follow:

1. Attach to alice container by running: `docker exec -it alice-php7 bash`
2. List design system content from node_modules by `ls -la /var/www/node_modules/theiconic/design-system/`
3. Check file you added exists.


#### Whats going with *docker-compose.override.yml** file?
Not much, basically `docker-compose.override.yml.dist` is a copy of `docker-compose.alice.yml` from docker multimachine repository.

This includes a slight modification to *mount a volume point to your local version of design system*.

```yml
#docker-compose.override.yml.dist:

version: '3'
services:
  alice-nginx:
  # ...
  alice-php7:
    # ...
    volumes:
      # ...
      - "${PATH_PROJECTS}/theiconic/design-system:/var/www/node_modules/theiconic/design-system"
    # ...
```

### 2. Linking Desing System in your host machine

1. Create a global symlink for `Design System` will be   done when you install the design system in your local via command

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
   But you can manually run below command to create a global symlink if you have installed an old version

   ```bash
   $ npm run link
   ```

2. After, simply run below script to link `Design System` in a project

   ```bash
   $ rm -f node_modules/design-system && ln -s ~/.npm/link/design-system node_modules/design-system
   ```

   or wrap it in a npm script, for example, in Alice it looks like below script

   ```json
   // in package.json
   {
      ...
      'link:ds': 'rm -f node_modules/design-system && ln -s ~/.npm/link/design-system node_modules/design-system',
      ...
   }

   // use it
   $ npm run link:ds
   ```

### 3. Connecting back in alice
Going to alice root, and executing following commands should be enough:

```bash
# install/update packages
$ yarn install

# link node_modules/design-system to /projects/path/design-system
$ npm run link:ds

# compile scss files and watch for changes
$ npm run watch:scss
```
