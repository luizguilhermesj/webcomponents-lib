Principles to apply in concert with The Iconic's brand and design vision. Please follow thorugh this when crafting digital customer experiences.

* **Customer first**: design starts with clear, data proven customer needs, behaviours and expected outcomes. Support our customers journeys with intuitive next actions and always avoid dead ends.

* **Simple**: well designed user interfaces are clear and focussed. Keep things concise.

* **Trustworthy**: good design is easy to trust and credible. Before asking users to perform or complete an action, lets make all efforts to help them understand the whys behind actions to be taken.

* **Accessible**: our experiences are designed to be accessible for all, regardless of device, ability, etc. Do not forget is a must.

* **Content driven**: design experiences message and intention first. Build experiences as scripted dialogues that speak with clarity and avoid using unfamiliar technicalities.
