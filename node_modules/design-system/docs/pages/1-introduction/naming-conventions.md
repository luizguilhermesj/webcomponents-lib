# [C]CTI - Convention

`[C]CTI` stands for `[Component] - Category - Type - Item`. It is a semantic structure naming convention.

This convention can be applied when naming: style properties, @mixins/@functions or even components, it is not meant to rigid, instead use it as a thinking framework when approaching naming.

## How it works?

Let's explain it for style properties, considering following CSS, try and find how to structure its properties as variables.

```scss
.button {
    color: #232323;
    background-color: #42abc8;
}

.active {
    color: #42abc8;
}
```

Style properties are organized into a hierarchical tree structure with a `'component'` defining the primary scope, and a `'category'` defining the primitive nature of the property.

```scss
.button { /* ... */ } // component 

.active { /* ... */ } // global
```

`[component]` scope is not always present when defining properties that are applied/used globally such as colors, border, sizes, etc. Therefore to generalize this concept we have:

* Within a component: **[ComponentName] + CTI**
* Non component related (global): **CTI**

Therefore for the example CSS the basic variables naming will be:

```scss
// _colors.scss

// globally
$color-blue: #42abc8;
$color-black: #232323;
```

Extending it to a more contextual naming:

```scss
// _colors.scss

// globally
$color-background-primary: $color-blue;
$color-border-base: $color-black;

// [button] component scope
$button-color-text-base: $color-black;
```

### Naming tree example

I this example tree, we have the color category and every property underneath is always a color property. As you proceed down the tree, you get more specific about what that color is. Is it a background color, a text color, or a border color? What kind of text color is it? You get the point. It's like the animal kingdom classification.

Structuring style properties in this manner give us consistent naming and accessing of these properties. You don't need to remember if it is:

* `$button-color-primary` ‚ùå, or
* `$primary-button-color` ‚ùå, it is always
* `$button-color-background-primary` ‚úÖ

## Variables name format

As you might be noticed already, variable names follow `kebab-case` format. That's it üç¢.

## TODO

* Migrate all variables under `src/settings` layer to CCTI.
* Setup `design-tokens` in the away of an [style-dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/).
