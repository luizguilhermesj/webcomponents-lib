## Sass documentation
Design system uses [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/)

SassDoc is to Sass what JSDoc is to JavaScript: a documentation system to build pretty and powerful docs in the blink of an eye.

## How it works?

* [SassDoc](http://sassdoc.com/) parses `src` folder to grab documentation-specific comments,
* those are specified by 3 consecutive slash characters `///` at the top of a sass declaration.
* from there, it builds fully styled HTML document

Like this:

Check our WIP: [Sass doc in apps dashboard](https://s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/live-design-system-assets/dist/sassdocs/index.html).

Anything from a `@function|@mixin|variable `inside a `.scss` can be documented by adding `///` comments with [annotations](http://sassdoc.com/annotations/).

## How to do annotations?
Please refer to the official documentation in regards [annotations](http://sassdoc.com/annotations/), It is very straight forward.
