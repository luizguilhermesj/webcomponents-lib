 The Iconic Design System hub it's a platform that integrates documentation, guidelines and design resources and that serves them as single source for UX design, code patterns and UI elements.

## What is The Iconic Design system
The Iconic Design system is a set of living guidelines that communicates our brand promise through our online experiences.

Our goal is to design experiences that work together, work the same way and work for our users across different projects. We build several different kind of products. So, this effort is relatively new and intentionally crafted to evolve through feedback from product teams and end users.

## Why should you use it?
 The Iconic Design system is meant to ensure/enforce design consistency and enable engineers and designers to work cohesively, quickly and efficiently. As well, it is the "single source of truth" for both the latest design paradigms, and the latest code examples.

Enjoy and remember to share your findings with us.
