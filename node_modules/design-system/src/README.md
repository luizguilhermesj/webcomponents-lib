## SCSS patterns

This folder contains visual patterns to be consumed/implemented in functional UI components.
The patterns are implemented in SCSS, independent of any specific component implementation.

## File organization
Basic file structure will follow basis of [ITCSS](https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/).

Files will be split into several layers as follows:

1.  Settings – Used with preprocessors and might contain wide use variables (like: font, colors, dimensions, z-index, etc).

2.  Tools – globally used mixins and functions.

> *!!* It’s important to notice, layers **1 -> 2** will not to output any CSS.

3.  Generic – reset and/or normalize styles, box-sizing definition, etc. This is the first layer which generates actual CSS.

4.  Elements – styling for bare HTML elements (like: h1, a, buttons, etc.). These come with default styling from the browser so it can redefine them here.

5.  Components – specific UI components. place UI components that are often composed of elements and other components.

6.  Utilities – utilities and helper classes with ability to strongly override anything in previous layers. (like: `.visually-hidden` helper class). CSS `important!` rule is allowed here, but discouraged in any other layer above.

!! It’s important to notice, layers 3 -> 6 can output CSS classes.

*Note:* ITCSS `objects` layer is not being use since it doesn't fit into this project approach.

## Code Style

All sass code is linted against the default rules outlined in [stylelint.io](https://stylelint.io/) via [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/stylelint-prettier).

Stylesheet and Javascript files must be auto formated before commits by running:

```bash
npm run fix:scss
# and
npm run fix:js
```

## Discoraged / @Deprecated
- Attaching properties by `tag` or `id` selectors will be consider invalid.
- All style properties must be attached to meaningful css class names.

```css
  /* invalid */
  h1, .h1-like { ... }
  div.container { ... }
  #my-button { ... }

  /* valid */
  .h1 { ... }
  .container { ... }
  .button--primary { ... }
```
