# Github users assigned to the file patterns here will be assigned as PR reviewers right away

# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important. The last matching pattern has the most precedence.
# So if a pull request only touches javascript files, only these owners
# will be requested to review.
